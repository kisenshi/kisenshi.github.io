      <description>Some code that can be shared with the world
 kisenshi.github.io I use something called Hugo, which is an amazing static webeite engine that allows me to have 100% control of the site; exactly what I was looking for. This repository contains the static code once it has been generated to be published. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s the site you are visiting at the moment! 
 Portal 2D Game developed using the GVGAI framework (forked into my repository) as assessment for the Game AI Module took at Goldsmiths University in February 2017.</description>

      <description>GVGP​ ​agents​ ​to​ ​evaluate​ ​automatic​ ​generated​ ​levels Procedural Content generation (PCG) refers to the generation of game content via automated processes. The validity of these artifacts should be checked to ensure their playability. Common approaches are game-specific and, although they ensure the playability of the generated content, they are limited by the game they are defined for. To solve this limitation, a strong connection between PCG and General Video Game Playing (referring to algorithms that do not take game-specific knowledge into account) could be established, as general controllers could be used to validate content generated for any game.</description>

      <description>What I do I&amp;rsquo;m an Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI) PhD student at Queen Mary University of London. 
What I&amp;rsquo;ve done I studied Computer Engineering at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain), moved to London and worked as a web developer (in different languages) for a couple of years. I decided to make a change in my career and opted for the Artificial Intelligence and games world, which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about!</description>
