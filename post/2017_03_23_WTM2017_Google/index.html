			<p>On 22nd of March 2017, I went to the super cool new <em>Google</em> offices in St Pancras Square to attend the annual <em>Google&rsquo;s International Women&rsquo;s Day Summit</em> organised by <em>WomenTechmakers</em> and, once again, I felt really inspired and lucky to belong to the amazing tech community.</p>

<p>The agenda looked really interesting so I was really looking forward to it. The registration opened up almost an hour before <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahdrinkwater"><strong>Sarah Drinkwater</strong></a> kicked off the event, which gave enough time to eat some cheese and delicious cupcakes and meet some of the other amazing attendees.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive post_img_right" src="/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/jessica_hummel_talk.jpg" alt="Welcome to the technology circus"></p>

<p>The opening remarks with the title <em>&ldquo;Everyone is welcome here&rdquo;</em>, by <strong>Suzanne Timmons</strong> (Operations Director at <em>Googler Engagement</em>) focused on diversity.</p>

<p>They were followed by the keynote <em>&ldquo;Welcome to the technology circus&rdquo;</em> by <strong>Jessica Hummel</strong>, Software Engineer at <em>Google</em>. She started saying that &ldquo;circus is to the body as tech to the mind&rdquo; and her talk focused on comparing technology with different performing arts in order to give a series of tips to success. She talked about theatre, dance, juggling, acrobatics and mentioned how it is important to recover from injuries and to enjoy the &ldquo;creation of the show&rdquo;. The tips taken from each of the arts are:</p>

<ul>
<li>From theatre -&gt; interaction. It is importanto to interact with other people and be open to their ideas, as having different views can help to achieve great things.</li>
<li>From dance -&gt; priorization.</li>
<li>From juggling -&gt; simplicity and focus. Starting simple, focusing in quality instead of quantity and increasing difficulty once the smaller tasks are achieved; always having in mind the big picture.</li>
<li>From acrobatics -&gt; learn and achieve.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary <strong>interact</strong>, <strong>prioritize</strong>, <strong>simplify</strong>, <strong>learn &amp; achieve</strong>, <strong>recover</strong> and <strong>enjoy</strong> to be successfull. And these tips could be applied to other aspects of life apart from arts or technology. It was a really inspiring talk; probably one of the most inspiring talks I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Afterwards, <a href="http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/Rebecca_Fiebrink_Goldsmiths/welcome.html"><strong>Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink</strong></a>, Lecturer at <em>Goldsmiths University</em>, talked about the use of <em>&ldquo;Machine Learning as a creative interaction design tool&rdquo;</em>, explaining the possibilty of using data for different creative purposes. She made a demo of <a href="http://www.wekinator.org/"><em>Wekinator</em></a>, an open source tool developed by her. It is capable of learning (very fast!) different interactions with the human through the webcam (or any other interactive device) allowing a very quick prototyping and refinement without the need of using code. Its applications are wide (from creating proffesional music and building instruments, to a face expression-meme mapping), giving artists the chance of taking advantage of the technology to express their creativity without the need of having programming-skills.</p>

<p>After a break, <a href="https://twitter.com/coderinheels"><strong>Gen Ashley</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sprinzette"><strong>Nicki Sprinz</strong></a>, <strong>Reem Al Seed</strong> and <strong>Svetlana Gulijajeva</strong> joined Sarah for an inspirational Panel. They talked about different topics: programs promoting diversity, mentorship, (good/bad) advices and culture in the workplace. They mentioned that a good culture is based on respect and if a company is not offering what you think it is a right culture for you, it is because you are not in th right place. Based on my experience, I couldnÂ´t agree more.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive post_img_center" src="/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/panel.jpg" alt="Panel"></p>

<p>The closing talk <em>&ldquo;Research and the Next Billion Users&rdquo;</em> was given by <strong>Jeannie Foulsham</strong>, Senior UX researcher at <em>Google</em>. It was focused on the challenge of creating and developing products for emerging markets like India. It is not only needed to take into consideration the technological development constraints like devices and connectivity issues, but also the cultural differences including languages, inputs and diversity challenges.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant evening and it is definitely one of the events of the year that it worth attending; will you join me next time?</p>
