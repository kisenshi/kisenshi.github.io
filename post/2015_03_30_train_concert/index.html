			<p><img class="post_img_right img-responsive" src="/img/posts/concerts/train_bulletproof_picasso.png" alt="Bulletproof Picasso"/> If I tell you that <em>Train</em> was in London you might ask me who they are. You may not know them by name but I´m sure you have heard some of their most famous songs at least once: <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5hZ88EF0tdJNs83F0nB2Ew" target="_blank">Hey, Soul Sister</a></em>; <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7zWj09xkFgA9tcV6YhfU6q" target="_blank">Drive by</a></em>; <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4NG6ezO2ApTR3dfQucNDqD" target="_blank">Drops of Jupiter</a></em>&hellip; Still no clue? Please make yourself a favour and go to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FUY2gzHeIiaesXtOAdB7A" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TrainVEVO" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, Google music, Itunes (or whatever you use to listen music), hit play (fall in love) and listen while reading!</p>

<p>The Californian band was formed in 1998 and they have released 7 albums since then; the last one, <em>Bulletproof Picasso</em>, is the reason why they are on tour now and I had the chance to see them live in the O2 Arena!</p>

<p>During almost two hours they went through all their albums performing a total of 20 songs! It was really cool listening all my favourite songs live in such an amazing place as the O2. (Yes, I was lucky and they played ALL my fav songs, which, in case you are curious, include <em>Angel in blue jeans</em>, <em>Bruises</em>, <em>Save me San Francisco</em>, <em>Drive by</em> and <em>Drops of Jupiter</em>, among others). It was my third concert in the O2 Arena and I can assure that it was, by far, the best one of them!</p>

<p><img class="post_img_left img-responsive" src="/img/posts/concerts/train_patrick_getting_closer_with_fans.png" alt="Patrick getting close with the fans"/>
Lately, it´s trendy in the concerts that the bands try to interact with the attendees, taking advantage of mobiles and the well-known selfie fever and <em>Train</em>, being aware of this, got close with the fans reaching a level I hadn´t seen before. Pat (the singer) started giving away some free t-shirts by throwing them to the crowd (sadly, although I was really close, I was not lucky enough to take one), including one signed by the whole band! This last one was really valuable and it triggered some problems in the Arena and I heard that even security had to intervene (not sure what exactly happened or who took the t-shirt home as, honestly, I was more interested in the concert than gossiping!). After, he asked for phones in order to take selfies and provide some fans a good souvenir of the concert (if you are wondering, I don&rsquo;t have a selfie either) and, after this, he jumped out the stage during a whole song to be closer to the fans and allow them to take pictures and sing with him!</p>

<p>The O2 was crowded (it is important to mention that it was a weekday Tuesday evening), the band gave their best and I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t disappoint their fans (or at least not me!); I had a great time. Before saying goodbye, they even invited the two supporting bands, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NatashaNorthVEVO" target="_blank">Natasha North</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMagicNumbersVEVO" target="_blank">The magic numbers</a></em> (a great discovering, and they deserve to be checked out as well), to join them in stage and perform a song with them. It was a great gesture and very well welcomed by everyone!</p>

<p>It was an amazing concert and they gave it closure performing <em>Drops of Jupiter</em> (obviously!); I really look forward to future concerts, maybe in San Francisco?! Dreaming is free!</p>
