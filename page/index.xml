      <description>Hello world! I&amp;rsquo;m Cris; a Spaniard in love with London, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been living since 2013. Although I had always enjoyed creative tasks as drawing and painting; I opted for a more technical career and I absolutely love it! I am passionate about solving problems, coding and the feel when something you have built actually works!
I worked as a web developer for a couple of years before I decided to make a change to the exciting world of AI and games.</description>
