&lt;h3 id=&#34;hello-world:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Cris and &lt;em&gt;Cheese with posts&lt;/em&gt; is my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Computer Engineer in love with London, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been living since 2013. Although I had always enjoyed creative tasks as drawing and painting; I opted for a more technical career and I absolutely love it! I am passionate about solving problems, coding and the feel when something you have built actually works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like travelling and, luckily, I have had the chance to travel a lot since I was a kid; I&amp;rsquo;ve been in many countries and visited amazing places; but I still have a huge list of places to go that keeps growing every day! I love music, TV series, cinema and discovering new places in the city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why the name&amp;hellip; Well, as I&amp;rsquo;ll write about different things: technology, my experiences, curiosities (basically all I feel like sharing with the world), I needed a general name, something different, original, easy to remember&amp;hellip; and everything tastes better with cheese; so it was perfect adding it to my blog as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
