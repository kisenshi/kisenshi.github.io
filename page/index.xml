&lt;h3 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Cris; a Spaniard in love with London, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been living since 2013. Although I had always enjoyed creative tasks as drawing and painting; I opted for a more technical career and I absolutely love it! I am passionate about solving problems, coding and the feel when something you have built actually works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked as a web developer for a couple of years before I decided to make a change to the exciting world of AI and games. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m studying a PhD in &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iggi.org.uk/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGGI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;em&gt;Queen Mary University of London&lt;/em&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about! I also like travelling, music, TV series, cinema and discovering new places in the city. I try to keep active outside the sedentary PhD life, mostly walking around the city, cycling and attempting different sports. Random facts are that my favorite game is Portal, I like medieval stuff (specially swords!) and my chosen superpower would be teleportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why the name of the siteâ€¦ Well, cheese can be added to anything and everything tastes better with cheese so it was perfect adding it to my personal site as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
