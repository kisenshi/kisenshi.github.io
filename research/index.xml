      <description>If having the interview in person is not an option for you, I have set up an online form with a series of questions related with game testing and the procedures carried out in your company, both when using human playtesters and automatic testing.
Please, consider filling the form if you have some time as it could be very helpful to set up my experiments and to shape my research. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to send me an email to c.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m based in London and go to Brighton very often, so if your company is based in one of these two locations (or close by), we could meet for a quick chat, giving me the chance to ask follow up questions and to clarify details that might come up from the answers.
To schedule an interview, or if you have any further questions, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to send me an email to c.</description>
