      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 22nd of March 2017, I went to the super cool new &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; offices in St Pancras Square to attend the annual &lt;em&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day Summit&lt;/em&gt; organised by &lt;em&gt;WomenTechmakers&lt;/em&gt; and, once again, I felt really inspired and lucky to belong to the amazing tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda looked really interesting so I was really looking forward to it. The registration opened up almost an hour before &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sarahdrinkwater&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Drinkwater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the event, which gave enough time to eat some cheese and delicious cupcakes and meet some of the other amazing attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_right&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/jessica_hummel_talk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Welcome to the technology circus&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening remarks with the title &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone is welcome here&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, by &lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Timmons&lt;/strong&gt; (Operations Director at &lt;em&gt;Googler Engagement&lt;/em&gt;) focused on diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were followed by the keynote &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to the technology circus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Hummel&lt;/strong&gt;, Software Engineer at &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt;. She started saying that &amp;ldquo;circus is to the body as tech to the mind&amp;rdquo; and her talk focused on comparing technology with different performing arts in order to give a series of tips to success. She talked about theatre, dance, juggling, acrobatics and mentioned how it is important to recover from injuries and to enjoy the &amp;ldquo;creation of the show&amp;rdquo;. The tips taken from each of the arts are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From theatre -&amp;gt; interaction. It is importanto to interact with other people and be open to their ideas, as having different views can help to achieve great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From dance -&amp;gt; priorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From juggling -&amp;gt; simplicity and focus. Starting simple, focusing in quality instead of quantity and increasing difficulty once the smaller tasks are achieved; always having in mind the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From acrobatics -&amp;gt; learn and achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary &lt;strong&gt;interact&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;simplify&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;learn &amp;amp; achieve&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;recover&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;enjoy&lt;/strong&gt; to be successfull. And these tips could be applied to other aspects of life apart from arts or technology. It was a really inspiring talk; probably one of the most inspiring talks I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_left&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/rebecca_fiebrink_talk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Machine Learning as Creative Interaction Design Tool&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/Rebecca_Fiebrink_Goldsmiths/welcome.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer at &lt;em&gt;Goldsmiths University&lt;/em&gt;, talked about the use of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Machine Learning as a creative interaction design tool&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, explaining the possibilty of using data for different creative purposes. She made a demo of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wekinator.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wekinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open source tool developed by her. It is capable of learning (very fast!) different interactions with the human through the webcam (or any other interactive device) allowing a very quick prototyping and refinement without the need of using code. Its applications are wide (from creating proffesional music and building instruments, to a face expression-meme mapping), giving artists the chance of taking advantage of the technology to express their creativity without the need of having programming-skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a break, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/coderinheels&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Sprinzette&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicki Sprinz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Reem Al Seed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Svetlana Gulijajeva&lt;/strong&gt; joined Sarah for an inspirational Panel. They talked about different topics: programs promoting diversity, mentorship, (good/bad) advices and culture in the workplace. They mentioned that a good culture is based on respect and if a company is not offering what you think it is a right culture for you, it is because you are not in th right place. Based on my experience, I couldn´t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/panel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Panel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing talk &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Research and the Next Billion Users&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; was given by &lt;strong&gt;Jeannie Foulsham&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior UX researcher at &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt;. It was focused on the challenge of creating and developing products for emerging markets like India. It is not only needed to take into consideration the technological development constraints like devices and connectivity issues, but also the cultural differences including languages, inputs and diversity challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a brilliant evening and it is definitely one of the events of the year that it worth attending; will you join me next time?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game AI Module Project - Portal 2D</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Game AI module I took at &lt;em&gt;Goldsmiths University&lt;/em&gt; on February 2017 it was needed to design, implement and playtest an AI-based game. There was no technichal constraints or limitations. The idea was making something that could be useful later for my research and, as I need to use the &lt;em&gt;GVGAI Framework&lt;/em&gt;, I opted to use it in order to get familiar with it. &lt;em&gt;Valve&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; series are in the top of my favourite games list (&lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/234/&#34;&gt;check them out&lt;/a&gt; if you haven&amp;rsquo;t),  so I decided to make my game based on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;architecture&#34;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gvgai-framework&#34;&gt;GVGAI Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EssexUniversityMCTS/gvgai&#34;&gt;GVGAI Framework&lt;/a&gt; it is a JAVA-based open source framework used for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gvgai.net/&#34;&gt;General Video Game AI Competition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports arcade-style 2D games built in &lt;em&gt;VGDL language&lt;/em&gt;. These (1 or 2 player) games can be easily set up to be played by a human or a controller. Because of the GVGAI competition, the framework is fully documented and there are lot of games an sample controllers available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the assessment, I simply forked the framework in my own repository to easily create a new game and a controller for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vgdl-language&#34;&gt;VGDL Language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Video Game Definition Language&lt;/em&gt; (VGDL) was initially implemented in python and ported to JAVA to be used in the framework for the competition. To create a game, it is just needed to declare two files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game description file&lt;/em&gt;. In this file it is declared the termination rules, objects, their interactions and how they should be mapped when defined in the level description file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level description file&lt;/em&gt;. This file should contain a 2D matrix of symbols corresponding to the elements defined in the mapping section of the game description file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a detailed explanation about the language can be found in the framework wiki I will not get into details in here. An easy example, taken from the Framework, are the description files for the game Sokoban. As shown, just a couple of lines of code are enough to create a very simple game, pictured below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;BasicGame key_handler=Pulse square_size=40
	SpriteSet
        floor &amp;gt; Immovable img=newset/floor2
        hole   &amp;gt; Immovable color=DARKBLUE img=oryx/cspell4
        avatar &amp;gt; MovingAvatar img=oryx/knight1
        box    &amp;gt; Passive img=newset/block1 shrinkfactor=0.8
        wall &amp;gt; Immovable img=oryx/wall3 autotiling=True
    LevelMapping
        0 &amp;gt; floor hole
        1 &amp;gt; floor box
        w &amp;gt; floor wall
        A &amp;gt; floor avatar
        . &amp;gt; floor
    InteractionSet
    	avatar wall &amp;gt; stepBack
    	box avatar  &amp;gt; bounceForward
    	box wall box  &amp;gt; undoAll
    	box hole    &amp;gt; killSprite scoreChange=1
    TerminationSet
    	SpriteCounter stype=box    
    	limit=0 win=True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wwwwwwwwwwwww
w........w..w
w...1.......w
w...A.1.w.0ww
www.w1..wwwww
w.......w.0.w
w.1........ww

wwwwwwwwwwwww
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/sokoban_example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sokoban example&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;game&#34;&gt;Game&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game I created for the assessment is based in &lt;em&gt;Valve&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; where 2 different player have to reach a different goal in order to win:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human (subject)&lt;/strong&gt;. Their goal is collecting the cake avoiding being killed, either being shot by the other player or steping into the traps allocated around the level. The player is allowed to move up, down, left or rignt and shoot to create Portals in the walls (one orange &amp;amp; one blue). It is possible to teleport between the Portals created in order to reach different areas of the level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turret&lt;/strong&gt;. Its goal is killing the &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; before they collect the cake. The player is allowed to move up, down, left or right and shoot a laser that immediately kills the other player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other elements needed to implement the game are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Floor and walls. Both characters are allowed to walk over the floor but they can&amp;rsquo;t go through walls so these define the shape of the level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trap. The turret character is allowed to walk through this object as it was floor but it is harmful for the human character as it kills them if they step onto it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake. Items collectable by the human character that triggers their victory if collected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laser shot. Launched by the turret character when the action is selected. It is a missile that moves in the same direction the player is facing to and kills the human character if hitted before a wall is ecnountered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portal shot (blue or orange). Launched by the human character when the action is selected. It is a missile that moves in the same direction as the player is facing and creates a Portal when hitting a wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portal (blue or orange). If two portals are created in the level (one orange and one blue), they allow the human character to teleport between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below it has been included a screenshot of the game created containing all the elements described: The turret has shot a laser trying to reach the human player, who has moved down to avoid it. The human player has created two Portals to be able to move to the area below (from the blue Portal to the orange Portal) without stepping into the traps in order to be closer to the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/game_screenshot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Game screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-behaviour&#34;&gt;AI behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the assessment, it was needed to include some kind of AI in the game. It was decided to develop a controller for the turret, focused on finding and killing the human. An overview of what it was implemented for the AI behaviour is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targetting/Searching states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathfinding: A*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pathfinding&#34;&gt;Pathfinding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_right&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/navigation_matrix.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Navigation matrix&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To allow an efficient way to move around the map, it was decided to use the &lt;strong&gt;A* algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;, considering every move with cost 1 and having the distance between the Start and Goal positions as the heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the algorithm, it was needed to identify the navigation matrix (valid positions for the turret), which would be used to identify the valid neighbours on-the-fly when the algorithm was run. For the level created, the navigation matrix is marked in orange-colour in the image on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the A* algorithm returned the list of positions that should be followed to reach the desired position, it was needed to convert these into valid actions to be followed by the turret. In the example below, as the turret is orientated to the right and the desired movement implies going down, it is needed to add an &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; action to turn and face the desired orientation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/positions_to_actions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Positions to actions&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;states&#34;&gt;States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;targetting&#34;&gt;Targetting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the human is in-sight, the logic is adapted to enter this state and plan the list of actions to kill them. If the turret has a list of actions already planned but the previous state was not &lt;em&gt;targetting&lt;/em&gt; the previous plan of actions is unrelevant as this is the most important status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;searching&#34;&gt;Searching&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the human is not in-sight, it is needed to find the best spot to be able to target them. The pathfinding algorithm is called and the actions planned to reach the desired position. If, while these list of actions are being carried out, there is no change of status, the turret would keep following them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_left&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/areas.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Areas&#34;&gt;
It was needed to take into cosideration the existance of different areas in the level, which are those limited by walls and traps where the human is forced to use a Portal to move between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was included an interruption in the seacrhing plan for the special case of the human not being the same area as they were when the pathfinding algorithm ran. If it is detected that the human has changed from an area to another, a new search is run to update the movement-actions plan in order to get closer to the player.
&lt;p/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;logic-implementation&#34;&gt;Logic implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;checking-if-human-in-sight&#34;&gt;Checking if human in-sight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check if the human is in sight, the visible spots in-line with the current position of the character are identified (marked in blue colour in the image below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these spots are identified, it is checked if the agent current position corresponds with one of those or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/human_in_sight_check.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Human-in-sight checking&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;targetting-the-human&#34;&gt;Targetting the human&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the human is in sight, the agent should shoot in the correct direction. In order to achieve this, it should change its orientation if it is not facing the human and shoot once the orientation is the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/targetting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Turret targetting the human&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;finding-the-best-spot-to-move-to&#34;&gt;Finding the best spot to move to&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best spot of the agent is the closest from where the human is in-sight at the moment. The spots previously identified are used, taking the one of those closest to the turret as goal for the pathfinding algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/game_ai_module/best_spot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Identifying the best spot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;dumbing-the-ai&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dumbing&amp;rdquo; the AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the AI was implemented and the game was tested, most of the feedback received was that the AI was too quick and it was &lt;del&gt;impossible&lt;/del&gt; too difficult to win the game. Because of this, it was decided to add some &lt;em&gt;doNothing&lt;/em&gt; actions when planning the actions to carry out. As a result, even when the logic is the same, it looks like the agent is slower and the player is given a chance to reach the cake before being killed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gameplay-video&#34;&gt;Gameplay video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below it is included a gameplay for a fully working game, where the turret (Player 1) is controlled automatically by the implemented AI and the human character (player 0) is controlled by a person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;video-container&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYGupL5YHAk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-code&#34;&gt;The code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, the framework was forked &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kisenshi/gvgai-gameAI-project&#34;&gt;into my own repository&lt;/a&gt;, where I created the game and implemented the AI logic. Some bugs were found during the playtesting session (they have been fixed) so the last up-to-date version can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kisenshi/gvgai-gameAI-project/tree/Portal2D-improvements-and-fixes&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal2D-improvements-and-fixes&lt;/em&gt; branch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-the-game&#34;&gt;Running the game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The files created for the game can be found at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;src/ModuleGame&lt;/em&gt; Main that runs the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;aimodule/cake.txt&lt;/em&gt; Game description file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;aimodule/cake_lvl0.txt&lt;/em&gt; Level description file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;src/controllers/aimodule/KillSubject/Agent.java&lt;/em&gt; Code of the controller for the turret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run the game, it is suggested to follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EssexUniversityMCTS/gvgai/wiki/GVG-Framework&#34;&gt;instructions provided&lt;/a&gt; in the framework wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the game!
And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to give &lt;em&gt;Valve&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; games a try because they are really good!! Just bear in mind that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kisenshi.github.io/post/2017_01_23_global_game_jam_2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href+&#34;http://globalgamejam.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Global Game Jam&lt;/a&gt; (GGJ) is an annual &lt;em&gt;game creation&lt;/em&gt; event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. At certain time, a theme is announced and &lt;em&gt;jammers&lt;/em&gt; have 48 hours to make a game based on it. Thousands of people participate all around the world, creating thousands of games (more than 7000 games have been created in the 2017 edition) and the number increases every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/post/2016_09_04_hello_iggi/&#34;&gt;IGGI&lt;/a&gt; signs up every year as one of the GGJ local sites, taking place in one of the collaborating institutions so, as part of the programme, I spent the weekend in York making a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme, &lt;em&gt;Waves&lt;/em&gt;, was announced at 6pm on Friday 20th and the brainstorming started. My team of three agreed on the game surprisely quickly and, althought we were missing an artist, we managed to create something decent by Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to make an original 2D game where the player would experience different emotions. The concept for &lt;em&gt;Her Resonance&lt;/em&gt; was born: The game would be about a girl who sees herself as a wave and go through the journey of her life, having different experiences when bumping into other waves (people). Girl&amp;rsquo;s mood would be reflected on her assigned frequency and it would change by resonance depending on the frequency of the waves she interacts with. The idea was having different states where the music and environment would change, depending on her mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, a &lt;strong&gt;poetry puzzle platformer&lt;/strong&gt; was created. The game is formed by 5 different states in the girl&amp;rsquo;s life: loneliness, exploration, calm, disturbance and acceptance. Each of the states are introduced to the player with a poem, presenting the story of the girl and the objective that should be reached to advance to the following state. As there were no artist in the team it was not possible to achieve exactly the environmental experience we were looking for. However, overall, a first version of the game was created; being possible to experience the journey with the full poetry in place, some background color updates and a beautiful soundtrack, so we were really happy with the results achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the York GGJ site, some prizes for different categories were given and our game, &lt;em&gt;Her Resonance&lt;/em&gt; won the prize for &lt;strong&gt;Best writing/storytelling&lt;/strong&gt; and an &lt;strong&gt;Honourable Mention for audio&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/her-resonance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her Resonance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was uploaded to the Global Game Jam site so the code and the executables for Windows and OSX can be found in there; try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am really excited to finally say &lt;strong&gt;Hello IGGI&lt;/strong&gt; as I am one of the new students in the University of Essex! It is a great opportunity and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what comes out of the next 4 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;But wait&amp;hellip; What is IGGI??&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Right! I&amp;rsquo;ll explain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI)&lt;/strong&gt; PhD programme is the biggest fully funded research programme in &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Games&lt;/em&gt; in the world. It is sponsored by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EPSRC&lt;/a&gt; and possible thanks to the collaboration of three institutions: &lt;em&gt;University of Essex&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Goldsmiths University of London&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;University of York&lt;/em&gt;. For detailed information refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iggi.org.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IGGI site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first Hackathon</title>
      <link>http://kisenshi.github.io/post/2015_03_11_my_first_hackathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 15:57:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kisenshi.github.io/post/2015_03_11_my_first_hackathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realised how big the tech community is here in London (I was completely blind before) and the amount of interesting events, meetups and workshops that can be found almost daily around the city. Last weekend I decided to attend to my first Hackathon and, although on Sunday I was completely exhausted, it was such a great experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackathon was organised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.talentedheads.com/2015/02/10/female-hackathon-planned-london-celebrate-international-womens-day/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talented Heads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and hosted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.makersacademy.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the International Women&amp;rsquo;s day, encourage diversity in tech and inspire more women to join this amazing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Makers Academy (really cool) offices on Saturday morning, all I knew was that we would build a project based on the theme &lt;em&gt;Make it Happen - Diversity in Tech&lt;/em&gt; and I needed to bring my laptop, curiosity and imagination; so I could not imagine what all we were there were about to achieve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; lang=&#34;en-gb&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the women who will &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MakeItHappen?src=hash&#34;&gt;#MakeItHappen&lt;/a&gt; in tech in the future. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/iwdhackathon?src=hash&#34;&gt;#iwdhackathon&lt;/a&gt; you go girls x &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/SBgSLWslvx&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SBgSLWslvx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talented Heads (@TalentedHeads) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TalentedHeads/status/574161010057211906&#34;&gt;March 7, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing ourselves and some talking, we were divided into groups to come up with an idea to solve one of the problems we had isolated during the brainstorming. The interesting thing at this point is that, unlike other Hackathons, where the team meanly consists of technical profiles, our teams were formed by women with different skills. This approach provided us various points of view and encouraged us to collaborate to be able to achieve our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;post_img_right img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/my_first_hackathon/cyoa_team.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CYOA team&#34;&gt;
My team was formed by two &lt;strong&gt;designers&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lowndesjo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JessicaLeach6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jess&lt;/a&gt;), two &lt;strong&gt;marketers&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SuzeShardlow&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Suze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alessia_camera&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;) and two &lt;strong&gt;developers&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/binaryberry&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tatiana&lt;/a&gt; and myself). I have to admit that we were very lucky as, without knowing each other at all, it turned out that we had different skills that complemented perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to focus on &lt;strong&gt;childhood&lt;/strong&gt;. We thought that the problem starts during this period, as there are lot of stereotypes and biases surrounding boys&amp;rsquo; and girls&amp;rsquo; daily environment that may affect the way they decide to live their life, and the decisions they take in the future. In general, girls use to get frustrated and give up easily when there is a problem, and the society doesn&amp;rsquo;t encourage them to keep trying and to not be afraid of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lot of deliberation, we came up with an idea we all loved: develop an &lt;strong&gt;educational story-telling platform&lt;/strong&gt; to teach the basic principles of coding and problem solving through interactive exercises. Children would access the platform and create stories based in their favourite fairy tales. Depending on their actions and answers, &lt;strong&gt;the story would change&lt;/strong&gt; (or even conclude) and the more they would progress in the story following &amp;ldquo;the correct path&amp;rdquo;, the more they would be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the idea was clear, it was time to start working and transform it in a real product to be shown the next day. It was needed a deep analysis, a marketing strategy, a research to find out possible competitors, a working prototype (oriented to the proper target), cute designs for the children&amp;hellip; and a bear, the bear was important! And we had just 24 hours to make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; lang=&#34;en-gb&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are back with lots of smiles! Brainstorming whilst having breakfast. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD2015?src=hash&#34;&gt;#IWD2015&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWDHackathon?src=hash&#34;&gt;#IWDHackathon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/makingithappen?src=hash&#34;&gt;#makingithappen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/4MISeaEjlw&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4MISeaEjlw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Daria Taylor (@daria_taylor) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/daria_taylor/status/574513998701395968&#34;&gt;March 8, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the technical part, we opted for using Ruby (with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sinatrarb.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. I had never used Ruby before so I needed to set up the environment and Tatiana spent some time explaining me the basics of Ruby and how Sinatra was structured. It took us some time to be able to actually start working in the product, but we managed quite well and I am very happy with what we were able to produce.
Collaborating, talking, sharing different opinions and ideas (and eating all the delicious food, juices and coffee provided by the lovely organizers) all my team was able to achieve a surprising good quality work in such a short period of time; &lt;a href=&#34;https://code-your-own-adventure.herokuapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Your Own Adventure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born and it was ready to be shown to the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://code-your-own-adventure.herokuapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/my_first_hackathon/cyoa_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;CYOA logo&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitching time! The moment to present the product we had been working on during the weekend had arrived, and everyone was tired, but really excited. The other two teams presented some really good ideas as well. One of them was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/techmentr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TechMentr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a platform to match mentors and mentees in tech; and &lt;strong&gt;Co(de)Create&lt;/strong&gt;, an e-learning platform oriented to support small projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To judge the projects, there was a jury conformed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/coderinheels&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gen Ashley&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-London/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women Who Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mseckington&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Melinda&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;FutureLearn&lt;/em&gt; and Clarice from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codefirst:Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After much deliberation, they announced &lt;strong&gt;Code Your Own Adventure&lt;/strong&gt; as the winning idea!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; lang=&#34;en-gb&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWDHackathon?src=hash&#34;&gt;#IWDHackathon&lt;/a&gt; teams also talked about marketing for (not just the tech aspect of) the ideas/products they developed. &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/91tUiEBe2X&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/91tUiEBe2X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gen A (@coderinheels) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/coderinheels/status/574592772071624704&#34;&gt;March 8, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing, &lt;strong&gt;our team had won&lt;/strong&gt;!!!! We were so happy and could not believe it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we started working on it, I knew it was a great idea, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to win. To be honest, I was having such a good time during the whole weekend and the environment was so friendly that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the feeling to be in &amp;ldquo;a competition&amp;rdquo;, but we were; and there were &lt;strong&gt;prizes&lt;/strong&gt;!!! We are going to receive a £75 amazon voucher, isn&amp;rsquo;t that great??! My earphones broke last week (and I cannot live without music), so I have quite clear what I am going to spend it on! I include Jess&amp;rsquo; tweet below with a photo of us with the jury so you can see by yourself how happy we were!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; lang=&#34;en-gb&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code Your Own Adventure! Winning team at IWD hackathon &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SuzeShardlow&#34;&gt;@SuzeShardlow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/binaryberry&#34;&gt;@binaryberry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lowndesjo&#34;&gt;@lowndesjo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CamTechWomen&#34;&gt;@CamTechWomen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/5KuODwN28v&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5KuODwN28v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jessica Leach (@JessicaLeach6) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JessicaLeach6/status/574665613551013889&#34;&gt;March 8, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, it was a &lt;strong&gt;great experience&lt;/strong&gt;, I met &lt;strong&gt;amazing women&lt;/strong&gt; passionate about &lt;strong&gt;tech&lt;/strong&gt;, I had fun and learnt a lot. Although on Sunday afternoon I was exhausted (both mentally and physically), it worth it and I would do it again! I have the feeling that I will be seen participating in many other Hackathons in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks the rest of attendees, the jury and the organizers for the amazing pics. It was possible and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;WE MADE IT HAPPEN!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Cris; a Spanish in love with London, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been living since 2013. Although I had always enjoyed creative tasks as drawing and painting; I opted for a more technical career and I absolutely love it! I am passionate about solving problems, coding and the feel when something you have built actually works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love games and I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started a PhD in &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iggi.org.uk/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGGI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;em&gt;University of Essex&lt;/em&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about! I also like travelling, music, TV series, cinema and discovering new places in the city. Random facts are that I like medieval stuff (specially swords!) and my chosen superpower would be teleportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why the name of the site… Well, cheese can be added to anything and everything tastes better with cheese so it was perfect adding it to my personal site as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use something called &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, which is an amazing static webeite engine that allows me to have 100% control of the site; exactly what I was looking for. This repository contains the static code once it has been generated to be published. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s the site you are visiting at the moment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-target-blank-href-https-github-com-kisenshi-gvgai-gameai-project-img-src-img-portfolio-logo-github-small-png-alt-github-a-portal-2d&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/kisenshi/gvgai-gameAI-project&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/portfolio/logo_github_small.png&#34; alt=&#34;GitHub&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Portal 2D&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game developed using the GVGAI framework (forked into my repository) as assessment for the &lt;em&gt;Game AI Module&lt;/em&gt; took at &lt;em&gt;Goldsmiths University&lt;/em&gt; in February 2017. The most up-to-date version can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kisenshi/gvgai-gameAI-project/tree/Portal2D-improvements-and-fixes&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal2D-improvements-and-fixes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solutions to &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://projecteuler.net/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Euler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; problems. For those who don´t know, Project Euler is an online platform that contains lot of problems to solve. I like solving problems and I thought it was a fun way to start using &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; and get familiar with the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that I publish in here my solutions, if you are using the platform I recommend &lt;strong&gt;not to spoil yourself&lt;/strong&gt;, give a try and solve them in your own; where is the fun in using my solutions as yours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-agents-to-evaluate-automatic-generated-levels&#34;&gt;General agents to evaluate automatic generated levels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Artificial Intelligence covers different areas, &lt;em&gt;Procedural Content generation&lt;/em&gt; (PCG) being one of them, which refers to the generation of game content via automated processes. This content generation process includes declaring a space and list of rules to be able to define and create artifacts, which are generated instances of content. One of the applications of PCG in the game industry is &lt;strong&gt;automatic level generation&lt;/strong&gt;. Agents are entities capable of carrying out certain actions in an environment to achieve a goal. Applying this concept to games, the goal is winning and, therefore, the agent will take a series of decisions to reach the victory. These decisions will be based on its knowledge of the surroundings and the game, so an agent designed to win a certain game will be optimized and developed specifically for that game. For example, an agent developed to play &lt;em&gt;Civilization II&lt;/em&gt;, knows it needs to build its civilization, develop it and produce different technologies along the game in order to, either, be the last civilization remained (conquering the other ones), or reach the &lt;em&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/em&gt; with a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Video Game Playing&lt;/em&gt; (GVGP) refers to a game domain where it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to use knowledge focused on a certain game, as the information is very limited or it does not exist at all. Consequently, the players (or agents) that are used in GVG should be created with algorithms that &lt;strong&gt;do not take game-specific knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; into account. Finding and improving these general algorithms is becoming an important field of research in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When new content is generated by automated processes, the &lt;strong&gt;validity of the artifact should be checked&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure its playability. Common approaches are game-specific and, although they ensure the playability of the generated content, they are limited by the game they are defined for. To solve this limitation, a strong connection between PCG and GVG could be established, as general controllers could be used to validate content generated for any game. My research proposal focuses on the &lt;strong&gt;use of GVG agents to evaluate new automated generated levels for games&lt;/strong&gt;. This evaluation will be answered in two different ways: with a numeric value, and with a quality answer, displayed in natural language, being sensible and readable by a human being. An evaluation tool will be built in order to compare real results given by humans with the results given by the set of agents. The human evaluations could be used as a reference to train the system to be capable to give a sensible answer to any automatic generated level. The response would be displayed in natural language, giving some reasons to the characteristics of the level evaluated, such as difficulty and entertainment. This response is expected to give the motive that would determine if a level should be used or not based on the expectations. For example, after the evaluation, the output would look like “This is a valid level. Also this level would be suitable from beginners as it has been determined that it is easy because (&amp;hellip;) Other characteristics to take into consideration are (&amp;hellip;)”. Having this kind of response, game designers and developers could easily determine if they would like to include the level in the game or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a game level evaluator that returns the results as expected is built, it will be investigated how to integrate this analyser in bigger systems that generates levels for different games. The combination of these techniques would allow automatically generating and evaluating levels, being able to accept or discard them based on the results processed by the agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-do&#34;&gt;What I do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PhD student&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;em&gt;University of Essex&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-ve-done&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied &lt;strong&gt;Computer Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Universidad Autonoma de Madrid&lt;/em&gt; (Spain), moved to London and worked as a web developer (in different languages) for a couple of years. I decided to make a change in my career and opted for the Artificial Intelligence and games world, which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about!
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-interests&#34;&gt;My interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interests include &lt;strong&gt;Procedural Content Generation&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;PCG&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;General Video Game Playing&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;GVGP&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;Natural Language Processing&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;NLP&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-iggi-programme&#34;&gt;The IGGI programme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to be one of the students in the &lt;strong&gt;IGGI&lt;/strong&gt; programme, which is a fully funded research programme in &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Games&lt;/em&gt;, sponsored by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EPSRC&lt;/a&gt; and possible thanks to the collaboration of three institutions: &lt;em&gt;University of Essex&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Goldsmiths University of London&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;University of York&lt;/em&gt;. For detailed information please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iggi.org.uk/&#34;&gt;IGGI site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
