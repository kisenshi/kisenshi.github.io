You may not know them by name but I´m sure you have heard some of their most famous songs at least once: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/5hZ88EF0tdJNs83F0nB2Ew&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hey, Soul Sister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/7zWj09xkFgA9tcV6YhfU6q&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drive by&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4NG6ezO2ApTR3dfQucNDqD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Drops of Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; Still no clue? Please make yourself a favour and go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FUY2gzHeIiaesXtOAdB7A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/TrainVEVO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, Google music, Itunes (or whatever you use to listen music), hit play (fall in love) and listen while reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Californian band was formed in 1998 and they have released 7 albums since then; the last one, &lt;em&gt;Bulletproof Picasso&lt;/em&gt;, is the reason why they are on tour now and I had the chance to see them live in the O2 Arena!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During almost two hours they went through all their albums performing a total of 20 songs! It was really cool listening all my favourite songs live in such an amazing place as the O2. (Yes, I was lucky and they played ALL my fav songs, which, in case you are curious, include &lt;em&gt;Angel in blue jeans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bruises&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Save me San Francisco&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Drive by&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Drops of Jupiter&lt;/em&gt;, among others). It was my third concert in the O2 Arena and I can assure that it was, by far, the best one of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;post_img_left img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/concerts/train_patrick_getting_closer_with_fans.png&#34; alt=&#34;Patrick getting close with the fans&#34;/&gt;
Lately, it´s trendy in the concerts that the bands try to interact with the attendees, taking advantage of mobiles and the well-known selfie fever and &lt;em&gt;Train&lt;/em&gt;, being aware of this, got close with the fans reaching a level I hadn´t seen before. Pat (the singer) started giving away some free t-shirts by throwing them to the crowd (sadly, although I was really close, I was not lucky enough to take one), including one signed by the whole band! This last one was really valuable and it triggered some problems in the Arena and I heard that even security had to intervene (not sure what exactly happened or who took the t-shirt home as, honestly, I was more interested in the concert than gossiping!). After, he asked for phones in order to take selfies and provide some fans a good souvenir of the concert (if you are wondering, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a selfie either) and, after this, he jumped out the stage during a whole song to be closer to the fans and allow them to take pictures and sing with him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The O2 was crowded (it is important to mention that it was a weekday Tuesday evening), the band gave their best and I&amp;rsquo;m sure they didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint their fans (or at least not me!); I had a great time. Before saying goodbye, they even invited the two supporting bands, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/NatashaNorthVEVO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Natasha North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMagicNumbersVEVO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The magic numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (a great discovering, and they deserve to be checked out as well), to join them in stage and perform a song with them. It was a great gesture and very well welcomed by everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing concert and they gave it closure performing &lt;em&gt;Drops of Jupiter&lt;/em&gt; (obviously!); I really look forward to future concerts, maybe in San Francisco?! Dreaming is free!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, The Script played in the O2 Arena for 17000 people and I was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;post_img_right img-responsive&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/concerts/the_script_painting_green.png&#34; alt=&#34;Paint the town green&#34;&gt;
The Irish band started the concert painting the Arena green and kept singing for one hour and a half going through most of their discography, encouraging the attendees to sing and jump with them to have a great Saturday night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They used as well a small stage in the middle of the stadium and, on his way back to the main one, Danny jumped into the stands, mic and GoPro in his hands, to be close to the fans and sing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this band as they have very motivational and inspiring songs (as &lt;em&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Superheroes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;It´s not right for you&lt;/em&gt;, my favourite!) and I had been waiting for the concert since I bought the tickets in October. It totally met my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave the fans all they wanted: music, lasers, tons of fun and a great performance of &lt;em&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/em&gt; to close an amazing show. I can´t wait for future tours! In the meantime I would have to remember that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;You got one life, to love what you do!!&lt;/h2&gt;
