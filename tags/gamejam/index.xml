      <description>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual game creation event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. At certain time, a theme is announced and jammers have 48 hours to make a game based on it. Thousands of people participate all around the world, creating thousands of games (more than 7000 games have been created in the 2017 edition) and the number increases every year.
IGGI signs up every year as one of the GGJ local sites, taking place in one of the collaborating institutions so, as part of the programme, I spent the weekend in York making a game.</description>
