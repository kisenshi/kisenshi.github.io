      <description>On 22nd of March 2017, I went to the super cool new Google offices in St Pancras Square to attend the annual Google&amp;rsquo;s International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day Summit organised by WomenTechmakers and, once again, I felt really inspired and lucky to belong to the amazing tech community.
The agenda looked really interesting so I was really looking forward to it. The registration opened up almost an hour before Sarah Drinkwater kicked off the event, which gave enough time to eat some cheese and delicious cupcakes and meet some of the other amazing attendees.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realised how big the tech community is here in London (I was completely blind before) and the amount of interesting events, meetups and workshops that can be found almost daily around the city. Last weekend I decided to attend to my first Hackathon and, although on Sunday I was completely exhausted, it was such a great experience!
The hackathon was organised by Talented Heads and hosted by Makers Academy to celebrate the International Women&amp;rsquo;s day, encourage diversity in tech and inspire more women to join this amazing industry.</description>
