      <description>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual game creation event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. Jammers have 48 hours to make a game based on a certain theme. This year it was transmission.
Last year I used Unity to develop a poetry puzzle platformer and, even when it was pretty chilled because my team took the decision to enjoy the experience, I had in mind doing something different this time; preferably avoiding the pain of setting up complicated environments and tools.</description>

      <description>On 19-20th September 2017, the Digital Economy Network (DEN), in collaboration with Digital Catapult, organised a two-days entrepreneurship workshop for EPSRC Digital Economy PhD students. As part of IGGI, I had the chance to attend.
On Tuesday I went to the Digital Catapult&amp;rsquo;s offices (where they have amazing views of St. Pancras!) with the idea of learning as much as possible from those two days, and I certainly did!
Philip Treleaven, professor at UCL, gave a series of lessons in entrepreneurship, including how to identify the idea, branding and vision, suggestions for the pitch and funding sources.</description>

      <description>As part of the Game AI module I took at Goldsmiths University on February 2017 it was needed to design, implement and playtest an AI-based game. There was no technichal constraints or limitations. The idea was making something that could be useful later for my research and, as I need to use the GVGAI Framework, I opted to use it in order to get familiar with it. Valve&amp;rsquo;s Portal series are in the top of my favourite games list (check them out if you haven&amp;rsquo;t), so I decided to make my game based on them.</description>

      <description>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual game creation event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. At certain time, a theme is announced and jammers have 48 hours to make a game based on it. Thousands of people participate all around the world, creating thousands of games (more than 7000 games have been created in the 2017 edition) and the number increases every year.
IGGI signs up every year as one of the GGJ local sites, taking place in one of the collaborating institutions so, as part of the programme, I spent the weekend in York making a game.</description>

      <description>At the IGGI Game Development Module I took at Goldsmiths University in November 2016, it was needed to develop a game using Unity. I teamed up with one of the other students of the programme, Rory Davidson, and we created a puzzle-platformer.
Game The idea of the game came up during the brainstorming session we had at the beginning of the module. We wanted to develop a game featuring penguins living in a city, being forced to steal fish in order to eat and survive.</description>

      <description>I am really excited to finally say Hello IGGI as I am one of the new students in the University of Essex! It is a great opportunity and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what comes out of the next 4 years!
But wait&amp;hellip; What is IGGI??  Right! I&amp;rsquo;ll explain!
The Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI) PhD programme is the biggest fully funded research programme in Artificial Intelligence and Games in the world.</description>
