      <description>As part of the Game AI module I took at Goldsmiths University on February 2017 it was needed to design, implement and playtest an AI-based game. There was no technichal constraints or limitations. The idea was making something that could be useful later for my research and, as I need to use the GVGAI Framework, I opted to use it in order to get familiar with it. Valve&amp;rsquo;s Portal series are in the top of my favourite games list (check them out if you haven&amp;rsquo;t), so I decided to make my game based on them.</description>
