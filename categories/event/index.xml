      <description>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual game creation event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. Jammers have 48 hours to make a game based on a certain theme. This year it was transmission.
Last year I used Unity to develop a poetry puzzle platformer and, even when it was pretty chilled because my team took the decision to enjoy the experience, I had in mind doing something different this time; preferably avoiding the pain of setting up complicated environments and tools.</description>

      <description>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual game creation event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. At certain time, a theme is announced and jammers have 48 hours to make a game based on it. Thousands of people participate all around the world, creating thousands of games (more than 7000 games have been created in the 2017 edition) and the number increases every year.
IGGI signs up every year as one of the GGJ local sites, taking place in one of the collaborating institutions so, as part of the programme, I spent the weekend in York making a game.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realised how big the tech community is here in London (I was completely blind before) and the amount of interesting events, meetups and workshops that can be found almost daily around the city. Last weekend I decided to attend to my first Hackathon and, although on Sunday I was completely exhausted, it was such a great experience!
The hackathon was organised by Talented Heads and hosted by Makers Academy to celebrate the International Women&amp;rsquo;s day, encourage diversity in tech and inspire more women to join this amazing industry.</description>
