      <description>On 19-20th September 2017, the Digital Economy Network (DEN), in collaboration with Digital Catapult, organised a two-days entrepreneurship workshop for EPSRC Digital Economy PhD students. As part of IGGI, I had the chance to attend.
On Tuesday I went to the Digital Catapult&amp;rsquo;s offices (where they have amazing views of St. Pancras!) with the idea of learning as much as possible from those two days, and I certainly did!
Philip Treleaven, professor at UCL, gave a series of lessons in entrepreneurship, including how to identify the idea, branding and vision, suggestions for the pitch and funding sources.</description>

      <description>On 22nd of March 2017, I went to the super cool new Google offices in St Pancras Square to attend the annual Google&amp;rsquo;s International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day Summit organised by WomenTechmakers and, once again, I felt really inspired and lucky to belong to the amazing tech community.
The agenda looked really interesting so I was really looking forward to it. The registration opened up almost an hour before Sarah Drinkwater kicked off the event, which gave enough time to eat some cheese and delicious cupcakes and meet some of the other amazing attendees.</description>

      <description>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual game creation event taking place worldwide in different physical locations. At certain time, a theme is announced and jammers have 48 hours to make a game based on it. Thousands of people participate all around the world, creating thousands of games (more than 7000 games have been created in the 2017 edition) and the number increases every year.
IGGI signs up every year as one of the GGJ local sites, taking place in one of the collaborating institutions so, as part of the programme, I spent the weekend in York making a game.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realised how big the tech community is here in London (I was completely blind before) and the amount of interesting events, meetups and workshops that can be found almost daily around the city. Last weekend I decided to attend to my first Hackathon and, although on Sunday I was completely exhausted, it was such a great experience!
The hackathon was organised by Talented Heads and hosted by Makers Academy to celebrate the International Women&amp;rsquo;s day, encourage diversity in tech and inspire more women to join this amazing industry.</description>
