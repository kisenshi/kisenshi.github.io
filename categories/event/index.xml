      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 19-20th September 2017, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitaleconomynetwork.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Digital Economy Network (DEN)&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Digital Catapult&lt;/a&gt;, organised a two-days entrepreneurship workshop for EPSRC Digital Economy PhD students. As part of IGGI, I had the chance to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I went to the Digital Catapult&amp;rsquo;s offices (where they have amazing views of St. Pancras!) with the idea of learning as much as possible from those two days, and I certainly did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_right&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/201709_DENworkshop/workshop_stpancras.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Starting up with St Pancras views&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Treleaven, professor at UCL, gave a series of lessons in entrepreneurship, including how to identify the idea, branding and vision, suggestions for the pitch and funding sources. These talks were really interesting as they provided a general overview of the steps to follow when you have an idea that you&amp;rsquo;d like to commercialize; or a way to put the researchs out there, converting what you are working, now or in the future, into a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also a series of talks given by former UCL students, who has succesfully started companies applying the knowledge they gained during their PhDs. They became with successfull companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://predictionio.incubator.apache.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PredictionIO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://brainpool.ai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brainpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.satalia.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Satalia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://coinstrats.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CoinStrats&lt;/a&gt; and shared their stories with us. They provided an insight of what becoming an entrepreneur involves, including the issues they have found during their journeys and what they&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from the experience. They gave a series of really good advices in case we&amp;rsquo;d like to follow their steps in the future and I felt very inspired by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop included a practical session where we had the chance to work with other attendees (PhD students from a range of different Universities) to identify a problem in the society and become with an idea to develop in order to solve it. We were divided into groups to work on a pitch to present the next day in front of the rest of the teams, and a panel, who would decide which team would win the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s DEN Pitching Competition, rewarded with £1000!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team, formed by Alex Owen (University of Southampton), Youssef Hamid (Loughborough University) and Yitong Huang (University of Nottingham), became with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CycleRack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which won the competition! The idea was based in the existing problem of the lack of safe bike parking in big cities, which results in thousands of bikes stolen every year. Most of the people living in cities like London live in flats with no storage space, which difficult the storage of their bikes at home or makes it very inconvenient. For most cyclist, parking their bikes in the street at night or at certain times is not an option. The solution we came up with was creating a dynamic social bike parking app, which would take advantage of private&amp;rsquo;s spaces (people&amp;rsquo;s homes or businesses), as secure rental spaces to park other people&amp;rsquo;s bikes for a period of time. It&amp;rsquo;s based on the idea of AirBnB and these kind of &amp;lsquo;on the move&amp;rsquo; social apps that has been successful, applied to a concept that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tried before. It took us some time to polish the idea and prepare the pitch, but it was really worth it as we were really happy with the final result and the presentation we did. I include a picture of the team when receiving the prize!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/201709_DENworkshop/cycleRack_team.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CycleRack team picture receiving the prize&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the big prize, there was also a People&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award, based on the choices of the rest of the teams, and rewarded with £250. The team of one of the colleagues in my program, Carlos Gonzalez Diaz (University of York), won this prize with their project &lt;em&gt;EmploAIble&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really good experience, I enjoyed the workshop and met other students working in very interesting projects, which I think it is very important as well. Thank you to everyone who work to make it possible!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Women Techmakers Summit 2017</title>
      <link>http://kisenshi.github.io/post/2017_03_23_WTM2017_Google/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 22nd of March 2017, I went to the super cool new &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; offices in St Pancras Square to attend the annual &lt;em&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day Summit&lt;/em&gt; organised by &lt;em&gt;WomenTechmakers&lt;/em&gt; and, once again, I felt really inspired and lucky to belong to the amazing tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda looked really interesting so I was really looking forward to it. The registration opened up almost an hour before &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sarahdrinkwater&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Drinkwater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the event, which gave enough time to eat some cheese and delicious cupcakes and meet some of the other amazing attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_right&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/jessica_hummel_talk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Welcome to the technology circus&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening remarks with the title &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone is welcome here&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, by &lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Timmons&lt;/strong&gt; (Operations Director at &lt;em&gt;Googler Engagement&lt;/em&gt;) focused on diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were followed by the keynote &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to the technology circus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Hummel&lt;/strong&gt;, Software Engineer at &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt;. She started saying that &amp;ldquo;circus is to the body as tech to the mind&amp;rdquo; and her talk focused on comparing technology with different performing arts in order to give a series of tips to success. She talked about theatre, dance, juggling, acrobatics and mentioned how it is important to recover from injuries and to enjoy the &amp;ldquo;creation of the show&amp;rdquo;. The tips taken from each of the arts are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From theatre -&amp;gt; interaction. It is importanto to interact with other people and be open to their ideas, as having different views can help to achieve great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From dance -&amp;gt; priorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From juggling -&amp;gt; simplicity and focus. Starting simple, focusing in quality instead of quantity and increasing difficulty once the smaller tasks are achieved; always having in mind the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From acrobatics -&amp;gt; learn and achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary &lt;strong&gt;interact&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;simplify&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;learn &amp;amp; achieve&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;recover&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;enjoy&lt;/strong&gt; to be successfull. And these tips could be applied to other aspects of life apart from arts or technology. It was a really inspiring talk; probably one of the most inspiring talks I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_left&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/rebecca_fiebrink_talk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Machine Learning as Creative Interaction Design Tool&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/Rebecca_Fiebrink_Goldsmiths/welcome.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer at &lt;em&gt;Goldsmiths University&lt;/em&gt;, talked about the use of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Machine Learning as a creative interaction design tool&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, explaining the possibilty of using data for different creative purposes. She made a demo of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wekinator.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wekinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open source tool developed by her. It is capable of learning (very fast!) different interactions with the human through the webcam (or any other interactive device) allowing a very quick prototyping and refinement without the need of using code. Its applications are wide (from creating proffesional music and building instruments, to a face expression-meme mapping), giving artists the chance of taking advantage of the technology to express their creativity without the need of having programming-skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a break, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/coderinheels&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen Ashley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Sprinzette&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicki Sprinz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Reem Al Seed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Svetlana Gulijajeva&lt;/strong&gt; joined Sarah for an inspirational Panel. They talked about different topics: programs promoting diversity, mentorship, (good/bad) advices and culture in the workplace. They mentioned that a good culture is based on respect and if a company is not offering what you think it is a right culture for you, it is because you are not in th right place. Based on my experience, I couldn´t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img-responsive post_img_center&#34; src=&#34;http://kisenshi.github.io/img/posts/women_techmakers_2017/panel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Panel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing talk &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Research and the Next Billion Users&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; was given by &lt;strong&gt;Jeannie Foulsham&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior UX researcher at &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt;. It was focused on the challenge of creating and developing products for emerging markets like India. It is not only needed to take into consideration the technological development constraints like devices and connectivity issues, but also the cultural differences including languages, inputs and diversity challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a brilliant evening and it is definitely one of the events of the year that it worth attending; will you join me next time?&lt;/p&gt;
